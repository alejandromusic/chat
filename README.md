chat
====

This is my version of a chat

It allows users to register, login and chat. The chat is only visible to 
those logged in.

Users have a smiley face as default when they sign up for an account but they can change it.

It is resistent to SQL injections but at the moment 

Improvements needed (currently working on)
- Site is vulnerable to XSS attacks. 
- Vulnerability when allowing users upload files.
- Page needs to become dynamic. Users only see new posts after submitting a request
